    "Last week, you got acquainted with parametric classifiers. You described a distribution using only a few parameters (mean and standard deviation) and tried to find the values for those parameters that best fit the data. This week, you will work on non-parametric classifiers. As the name implies, these classifiers do not use parameters to describe their data. Instead, they directly use training data in the classification process, or set up rules to classify new samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular example of non-parametric classifiers is the K-Nearest Neighbours (K-NN) classifier. In this exercise, you will find out how it works by implementing it yourself and you'll get to know in what circumstances to use it. In this assignment, we will walk you through the following steps in the K-NN algorithm:\n",
