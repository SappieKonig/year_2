    "\n",
    "Say, you want to classify apples vs. oranges. A _feature_ that you could use to classify them is their colour. We know, of course, that oranges are orange and apples (the golden delicious kind) are green, but each orange is a slightly different shade of orange. Likewise, the apples are all a different shade of green. If we would plot the colour values against the number of fruits with that colour, we would see, however, that there are probably more oranges with a certain type of shade than with other colours. They tend to follow known probability distributions.\n",

We will then use Bayes' rule to build a classifier based on the probability distribution.\n",
